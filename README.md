# msfs-h145-continuous-activator
Run this Python script and have the HPG Airbus H145 activated without needing to manually run Activator.exe every 2 hours. If for some reason H145 insists on activation, use the "Toggle alternate static" hotkey to force-read the up-to-date license file (default: ALT+S).
